# - Function for marking targets as being only for testing
# This module provides the function ECM_MARK_AS_TEST().
#
# The ECM_MARK_AS_TEST function is used to indicate that a target should only
# be built if the BUILD_TESTING option (provided by CTest) is enabled.
#
# ECM_MARK_AS_TEST( target1 target2 ... targetN )
#
# If BUILD_TESTING is False, then targets marked as tests are exluded from
# the ALL target. They are all part of the 'buildtests' target though, so
# even if building with BUILD_TESTING set to False, it is possible to build
# all tests by invoking the 'buildtests' target.

if (NOT BUILD_TESTING)
  if(NOT TARGET buildtests)
    add_custom_target(buildtests)
